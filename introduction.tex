This chapter introduces this dissertation, by first presenting its context,
motivation, and project's objectives, on sections~\ref{sec:intro:context},
\ref{sec:intro:motivation}, and~\ref{sec:intro:objectives}, respectively.

Finally, section~\ref{sec:intro:outline} describes the document outline.

\section{Context} \label{sec:intro:context}

% Esta secção descreve a área em que o trabalho se insere, podendo
% referir um eventual projeto de que faz parte e apresentar uma breve
% descrição da empresa onde o trabalho decorreu.

\evm{} is a method, recently presented at
\emph{SIGGRAPH}\footnote{\url{http://www.siggraph.org/}} 2012, capable of
revealing temporal variations in videos that are impossible to see
with the naked eye. Using this method, it is possible to visualize
the flow of blood as it fills the face~\cite{Wu2012Eulerian}.
And to assess the heart rate in a contact-free way using a
camera~\cite{Wu2012Eulerian, Poh2010Non, Poh2011Advancements}.

The main field of this research work is \emph{image processing
and computer vision}, whose main purpose is to translate dimensional
data from the real world in the form of images into numerical
or symbolical information.

Other fields include \emph{medical applications}, \emph{software
development for mobile devices}, \emph{digital signal processing}.

This research work was developed at \emph{Fraunhofer
Portugal}\footnote{\url{http://www.fraunhofer.pt/}} with the supervision of
Luís Rosado. Fraunhofer Portugal is a non-profit private association
founded by Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft\footnote{\url{http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/about-fraunhofer/}}~\cite{Fraunhofer2013} and

\section{Motivation} \label{sec:intro:motivation}

% Apresenta a motivação e enumera os objetivos do trabalho terminando
% com um resumo das metodologias para a prossecução dos objetivos.

There has been some successful effort on the assessment of vital
signs, such as, heart rate, and breathing rate, in a contact-free
way using a webcamera~\cite{Wu2012Eulerian, Poh2010Non, Poh2011Advancements},
and even a smartphone~\cite{Vitrox2013, Philips2013}.

Other similar products, which require specialist hardware and are
thus expensive, include \emph{laser Doppler}~\cite{Ulyanov1993Pulse},
\emph{microwave Doppler radar}~\cite{Greneker1997Radar}, and
\emph{thermal imaging}~\cite{Garbey2007Contact}.

Since it is a cheaper method of assessing vital signs in a
contact-free way than the above products, this research work has
potential for advancing fields, such as, \emph{telemedicine},
\emph{personal health-care}, and \emph{ambient assisting living}.

Despite the existence of very similar products by
\emph{Philips}~\cite{Philips2013} and
\emph{ViTrox Technologies}~\cite{Vitrox2013}
to the one proposed on this research work, none of these implement
the \evm{} method.

Due to being recently proposed, the \evm{} method implementation
has not been tested in smartphones yet.

\section{Objectives} \label{sec:intro:objectives}

% Enumera os objetivos do trabalho terminando
% com um resumo das metodologias para a prossecução dos objetivos.

In this work, an Android application for monitoring vital signs based on
the \evm{} method will be developed, which should include the following
features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item heart rate detection and assessment based on the \evm{}
        method;
  \item display real-time changes, such as, the magnified blood
        flow, obtained from the \evm{} method;
  \item deal with artifacts' motion, due to, person and/or
        smartphone movement.
\end{itemize}

In order to accomplish that, the feasibility of the \evm{} method on
smartphones has to be tested.

It should be noted that a straightforward implementation of the \evm{}
method is not possible, due to various reasons. First, the \evm{} method
provides motion magnification along with color magnification which will
introduce several problems with artifacts' motion. Second, the requirement
of implementing a real-time smartphone application will create performance
issues which will have to be addressed and trade-offs will have to be
considered.

The application performance should then be evaluated through tests
with several individuals and the assessed heart rate compared to
the ones detected by another application~\cite{Vitrox2013, Philips2013},
and to the measurement of an electronic sphygmomanometer.

\section{Contributions} \label{sec:intro:contributions}

The work of this thesis contributes to the current state of the art by
testing the feasibility of implementing a performance optimized version of
the \evm{} method for color amplification in order to be capable of being used
on a smartphone at a reasonable frame rate.

In addition, it also tests the usage of such method in the assessment of
a person's heart rate using the smartphone's camera. This shows that the method
is ready to be used on mobile devices and that it can start being used in
other kinds of applications.
